This game has been my first javascript micro-project. I was seeking to gain as high an understanding of React as it is possible, for later projects to improve.

The idea is based on the classic Minesweeper game, and uses all its original functionalities and features, including:
* placing flags
* having a timer
* if the finished time is in the top 10, the user may save their high score.

Later on, the project has been updated to use ScSS and moved towards a more component-based structure.
